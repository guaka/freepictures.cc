  <strong>FreePictures.cc</strong> tries to make it easy to get
  pictures that can be freely used for many purposes. All pictures are
  available under
  permissive <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative
  Commons</a> licenses or even in the public domain.  We will also try
  to explain what you can and what you cannot do with pictures under
  these specific licences.  It hasn't really come off the ground.  So
  that it might be useful for other people as well some day.
