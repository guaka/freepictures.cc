  <strong>FreePictures.cc</strong> tries to make it easy to get
  pictures that can be freely used for many purposes. All pictures are
  available under
  permissive <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative
  Commons</a> licenses or even in the public domain.  We will also try
  to explain what you can and what you cannot do with pictures under
  these specific licences.  It hasn't really come off the ground.  So
  that it might be useful for other people as well some day.

<template name="copyright">
<strong>Copyright</strong> is based on a complicated collection of laws, that vary in different countries.  Every country has their own legislation.  On top of that big corporations (such as Disney and other Hollywood giants) are trying to get to a "uniform" copyright legislation all over the world. This wouldn't be bad weren't it for the fact that it means that copyright legislation is becoming stronger and longer and giving copyright holders much more power.  In the end Mickey Mouse (1928) will never enter the public domain. The same public domain that Disney has taken countless stories from to turn into profit.

Fortunately <strong>Creative Commons</strong>, founded by Lawrence Lessig, an American professor at Harvard Law School and 2 other experts in law, is there to make our lives easier again.  The licenses that Creative Commons created allow creators of copyrightable works to give freedom to other people without them specifically having to contact the creator.

Creative Commons licenses allow creators to give certain freedoms to people while retaining certain rights.

There are 4 different clauses, from which licenses can be built:
<blockquote>
  Attribution (by)Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by these.
  Noncommercial (nc)Licensees may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only for noncommercial purposes.
  No Derivative Works (nd)Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform only verbatim copies of the work, not derivative works based on it.
  Share-alike (sa) Licensees may distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs the original work.
</blockquote>


There are several different Creative Commons licenses, but on all of the licenses it's required to attribute the creator (the so called <strong>BY</strong> clause).

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<template name="about">
<strong>FreePictures.cc</strong> is self-descriptive. Here you will be able to find free pictures organized by topic that will be available under a Creative Commons license, free as in free beer and free as in free speech.  Free for non-commercial use and sometimes also for commercial use.  It means you will be able to use these pictures like you would use stock photos, the only thing you need to do is give attribution.  And sometimes you will need to provide your changes under the same conditions (the so called sharealike clause).

We first experimented with free pictures of <a href="/furniture">furniture</a> - which was based on some successful experiments on the <a href="http://meubelen-meubels.nl/">Dutch</a> and <a href="http://xn--moebel-mbel-yfb.de/">German markets for quality furniture</a>.

Goals:
- provide pictures
- easy to find and re-use pictures that can be freely used for other purposes
- clear licensing, explain what it means
- clear attribution, explain how to attribute
